<h1>Interrupt handlers for the 9x8 micro controller</h1><br/>
Copyright 2012, Sinclair R.F., Inc.<br/><br/>
This document describes how to implement interrupt handlers for the 9x8 micro
  controller.<br/><br/>
There is a single interrupt in the controller, although this interrupt can be
  triggered by more than one signal.  Implementing interrupts consists of two
  actions:  adding a single interrupt peripheral to the processor architecture
  and adding a ".interrupt" body to the assembly source.<br/><br/>
The interrupt test bench illustrates how to add an interrupt for a single
  external event and the design in <tt>example/interrupt</tt> illustrates how to
  add an interrupt for two events, one external to the processor and one
  internal to the processor.<br/><br/>
<h2>Theory of Operation</h2>
  The interrupt peripheral creates two signals, <tt>s_interrupt</tt> and
  <tt>s_interrupted</tt>, for the interrupt event and to disable normal
  processor operation until the interrupt handler is running.<br/><br/>
  Specifically, <tt>s_interrupt</tt> is a non-registered signal that is high
  when (1)&nbsp;interrupts are enabled, (2)&nbsp;an interrupt edge has occurred
  (and not be precluded by the interrupt mask, if any), and (3)&nbsp;the
  processor is not in the middle of executing a jump, call, or return.<br/><br/>
  When <tt>s_interrupt</tt> goes high, the processor pushes the PC address for
  the current instruction onto the return stack, sets the next PC address to be
  the interrupt handler start address (so that the interrupt handler will start
  executing in 2&nbsp;instruction cycles), and otherwise performs a "nop."
  Because of the piplined PC/opcode architecture, a delay register is required
  for the current opcode PC address to be available.<br/><br/>
  The instruction cycle after <tt>s_interrupt</tt> is high must perform a "nop."
  This is done by using <tt>s_interrupted</tt> as a registered, delayed, version
  of <tt>s_interrupt</tt>.  When <tt>s_interrupted</tt> is high, the processor
  core is coerced to perform a "nop" and the instruction pipeline architecture
  starts fetching the second instruction in the interrupt handler.<br/><br/>
  When the "return" opcode is performed by the interrupt handler, execution will
  resume at the instruction that would have been performed when
  <tt>s_interrupt</tt> was high.  This instruction cannot be one immediately
  after a <tt>jump</tt>, <tt>call</tt>, or <tt>return</tt> or one after a
  <tt>jumpc</tt> or <tt>callc</tt> if the conditional was true, otherwise the
  processor will not perform the desired jump, call, or return and will simply
  start executing the code following the instruction after the jump, call, or
  return.<br/><br/>
  On&nbsp;return from the interrupt handler, the interrupts are enabled in a way
  that precludes the interrupt handler from being interrupted again.  This is
  done with the three instruction sequence "<tt>O_INTERRUPT_ENA return
  outport</tt>."  The outport, as the instruction performed immediately after
  the return, enables interrupts on the following instruction cycle, which will
  be the first instruction cycle resuming the previous execution
  sequence.<br/><br/>
  The interrupt peripheral needs to generate the <tt>s_interrupt</tt> and
  <tt>s_interrupted</tt> signals and the <tt>O_INTERRUPT_DIS</tt> and
  <tt>O_INTERRUPT_ENA</tt> outport strobes; create signals for any interrupt
  signals external to the processor; and instantiate the HDL for the
  interrupt.  Using the base class <tt>SSBCCinterruptPeripheral</tt> from
  <tt>ssbccPeripheral</tt> ensures the <tt>s_interrupt</tt> and
  <tt>s_interrupted</tt> signals are declared, although the code to generate
  their values is not created, and it ensures the two outport strobes are
  created.<br/><br/>
<h2>Example Implementation</h2>
  The interrupt peripheral provided with the core provides an interface for one
  to eight edge triggered interrupts.  These interrupt sources can be external
  to the processor or they can be signals from other peripherals.  They are
  normally rising edge triggered, but they can also be falling edge triggered.
  The peripheral also provides an optional mask for the interrupt sources,
  allowing it to be set, read, and initialized to a particular value.
  Constants for bit maps for the interrupt signals can be defined as part of
  selecting the signal for each of the one to eight interrupt signal
  sources.<br/><br/>
  The test bench for this interrupt peripheral illustrates a single, external,
  rising-edge interrupt signal.  The timing of the external interrupt was varied
  to validate correct generation of the <tt>s_interrupt</tt> signal and return
  from the interrupt handler (this was done by manually verifying the
  displayed instruction sequences).<br/><br/>
  An example interrupt controller for two interrupt signals, one external and
  one internal, and one rising edge and one falled edge, along with a mask for
  the interrupt signals, is also provided in
  <tt>example/interrupt</tt>.<br/><br/>
<h2>Construction of Interrupt Peripherals</h2>
  This discussion is based on the interrupt peripheral provided with the 9x8
  processor core.  It&nbsp;describes the HDL required to implement the interrupt
  hardware.<br/><br/>
  The processor core sets <tt>s_bus_pc</tt> to <tt>C_BUS_PC_JUMP</tt> when a
  jump or call is performed and it sets it to <tt>C_BUS_PC_RETURN</tt> when a
  return is being performed.  When <tt>s_bus_pc</tt> is either one of these
  values at the end of a processor clock cycle, then the instruction pipeline
  will be in the middle of performing a jump, call, or return during the
  following interval.  During this subsequent interval, interrupts must be
  disabled.  This is done by capturing the status of <tt>s_bus_pc</tt> in the
  register <tt>s_in_jump</tt> and prohibiting interrupts if <tt>s_in_jump</tt>
  is high.<br/><br/>
  The status of candidate interrupt signals is captured in
  <tt>s_interrupt_raw</tt>.  I.e., signal inversion is performed as required by
  the peripheral architecture statement and masking is performed where the mask
  is high if the signal is to be included as a candidate interrupt.  The "raw"
  interrupt triggers are then generated by looking for rising edges in this
  signal as compared to the value(s) for the previous clock cycle.<br/><br/>
  Two signals are then used to capture the trigger.  The first,
  <tt>s_interrupt_trigger</tt> records which enabled signals had a rising edge.
  In&nbsp;order to reduced the depth of subsequent logic for the interrupt
  signal itself, the single-bit signal <tt>s_interrupt_trigger_any</tt> records
  whether or not any enabled signal had a rising edge.  The history of both of
  these signals is cleared if the processor reads the input port for
  <tt>s_interrupt_trigger</tt>.<br/><br/>
  The non-registered interrupt signal is then generated if (1)&nbsp;interrupts
  are enabled, (2)&nbsp;a rising edge has occured, and (3)&nbsp;interrupts are
  not disabled because the instruction pipeline is in the middle of a jump,
  call, or return.<br/><br/>
  A&nbsp;delayed version of <tt>s_interrupt</tt> is registed as
  <tt>s_interrupted</tt> for generation of the interrupt-induced "nop"
  instruction that must follow the interrupt.<br/><br/>
  Finally, the interrupt enable signal is generated.  Interrupts are initially
  disabled (so that the processor can perform its initialization without
  spurious stated induced by premature interrupts).  Interrupts are then
  disabled when an interrupt occurs or when the <tt>O_INTERRUPT_DIS</tt> strobe
  is received.  Interrupts are only enabled when the <tt>O_INTERRUPT_ENA</tt>
  strobe is received.<br/><br/>
<h2>Construction of Interrupt Handlers</h2>
  If&nbsp;there is only one signal that can produce an interrupt (as set in the
  peripheral architecture statement), then the interrupt handler simply
  processed the interrupt and exits using the <tt>.returni</tt> macro.  For
  example, the following code simply counts the number of interrupts received
  (provided that they don't occur so fast that the interrupt handler isn't
  called as fast as the interrupts occur):<br/><br/>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;.interrupt<br/></tt>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.fetchvalue(interruptCount) 1+ .storevalue(interruptCount)<br/></tt>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.returni<br/></tt><br/>
  If&nbsp;there is more than one signal that can produce an interrupt, then the
  construction of the interrupt handler is slightly more complicated.  Suppose
  the interrupt peripheral architecture statement is:<br/><br/>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;PERIPHERAL&nbsp;interrupt&nbsp;insignal0=i_int0,C_INT0&nbsp;\<br/></tt>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;insignal1=i_int1,C_INT1&nbsp;\<br/></tt>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inport=I_INTERRUPT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\<br/></tt>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br/></tt><br/>
  The interrupt handler then reads the interrupt trigger, conditionally calls
  subroutines for the appropriate interrupt, clears the trigger from the data
  stack, and returns as follows:<br/><br/>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;.interrupt<br/></tt>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.inport(I_INTERRUPT)<br/></tt>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dup C_INT0 &amp; .callc(int0)<br/></tt>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dup C_INT1 &amp; .callc(int1)<br/></tt>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drop<br/></tt>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.returni<br/></tt><br/>
