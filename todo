  ssbcc
1   generate memories for RAM and ROM
    add interrupt handling
    add optional fast version of the data and return stacks
    do VHDL
    add exception handler
    clean up temporary files

  core/9x8
    core.v
*     change comparisons to 0=, 0<>, -1=, and -1<>
*     register s_N -- experiments show much faster and less logic
1     finish the core
        - store and fetch
2     fully debug the core
      resolve ISE synthesizing 50 slices instead of 36
    asm
      add loop labels to the output instruction list
      implement .constant directive
      implement .abbr directive
1     fully process .memory and .variable directives
      reduce range of fetch instruction
      add .fetch(name,N) and .store(name,N) macros
      process strings and their escape characters correctly, process both counted and null-terminated strings
      add optimizer
        - "dup push outport drop" ==> "push outport"
        - "XXX return nop" ==> "return XXX" where XXX doesn't involve the return stack
        - "dup push store drop" ==> "push store"
        - "push+outport+drop push+jump/call+nop" ==> "push+outport push+jump/call+drop"
      add exception handler
    core.vhd
      do this once core.v is completed
