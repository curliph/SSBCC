  generate the memories for the program space, stack, and return stack
  with "core/9x8/asm" fully process .memory and .variable directives
  do VHDL

core/9x8
  core.v
    finish the core
    debug the core
  asm
    add locations of .main and .interrupt and program length to ':program'
    add option to generate ".lst" files with code listing and generated instructions
    implement .constant directive
