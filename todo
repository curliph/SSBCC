  BUGS:
    gracefully handle "eval(...,ad.SymbolDict())" errors
    bad "drop" was not caught by "monitor_stack"
 
  ssbcc
    add optional signal initialization for OUTPORT with format "X-bit=init"
    add CONSTANT configuration command so that bit definitions can accompany their definition
    add "function"s for use by peripherals and incorporate all functions at the top of the peripheral section
    ensure ARCHITECTURE is the first non-comment line
    validate signal names
      ensure that inport, outport, signal, and io names are not repeated
      ensure no colisions with signals within the core
    add config['parameters'] and usage for peripherals
    search paths for peripherals (code directory, core/9x8/peripherals, core/peripherals)
    put ssbccGenVerilog in a class in core/9x8
    Finish interrupt handling

      speed up core
      determine settings to maximize speed or minimize resources
      finish interrupt handling
    asm
      change $(...) to ${...} so that parentheses can be parsed
      required .memory directive to be repeated after .include, EOF, etc.
      improve error message for missing input files
      add non-return restriction to some optional macro arguments
      implement .abbr directive

      add the architecture line number to __init__
**    add a 'function' key to config for:
        clog
        instruction dump
      finish "monitor_stack" periperhal:
        add "finish=n"
        add "history=n"
        add "log"
*     finish "UART_Tx" peripheral
        accomodate parameter names in baudmethod
        add "FIFO=n"
