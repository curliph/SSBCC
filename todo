  ssbcc
1   generate memories for RAM and ROM
    process string and their escape characters correctly, process both counted and null-terminated strings
    add interrupt handling
    add optional fast version of the data and return stacks
    add a way for users to include a substantial comment in the header of the output processor.
    do VHDL

  core/9x8
    core.v
*     add +u16, +s16, -u16, -s16, *u8u8, *u8s8, *s8u8, and *s8s8 operators
*     change jump and jumpc to include the call and callc opcodes by pushing the PC onto the return stack and
        - this reduces the jump address space by 1 bit (from 16K to 8K)
1     finish the core
2     fully debug the core
      resolve ISE synthesizing 50 slices instead of 36
    asm
      add option to generate ".lst" files with code listing and generated instructions
      implement .constant directive
      implement .abbr directive
1     fully process .memory and .variable directives
      add .fetch(name,N) and .store(name,N) instructions
      add optimizer
        - "dup push outport drop" ==> "push outport"
        - "XXX return nop" ==> "return XXX" where XXX doesn't involve the return stack
        - "dup push store drop" ==> "push store"
    add VHDL core
