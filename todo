  BUGS:

  ssbcc
*   write COMBINE MEMORY tests
    add "share memory" feature?
      for dual-port memories in slave peripherals (i.e., registers readable by the bus master)
      for peripherals such as adders where long chains of outputs and inports would have been required and .store+/- and .fetch+/- would be much more efficient code-wise
      how to accommodate multiple "shared memory" peripherals?
    finish interrupt handling
    remove dead parameters and dead code
    rework design as required to make it more robust
    use _doc_string_ comments throughout
    documentation
      top-level overview, point to implemented cores
      required:  ARCHITECTURE and sizes, ASSEMBLY, and HDL
      I/O Ports
      INPORT and OUTPORT
      PERIPHERAL
        finish doc/peripheral.html
      all error messages
    generate Altera SOPC/Qsys TCL script
    add VHDL

  core/9x8
    documentation
      update
      assembler
        directives
        instructions
          change "opcodes.html" to "instructions.html", ...
        parameters
        constants
        interrupts
      peripherals
      running the test benches
    core.v
      additional instructions?
        "invert" opcode in 6'b000100 group
        "tst&=" and "tst&<>" instructions -- replace T with the stated comparison based on the bitwise and of T and N
        "cmp=" and "cmp<>" instructions -- replace T with the statued comparison based on N-T
    asm
      require .memory directive to be repeated after other directives, EOF, etc.
      improve error message for missing input files
      add non-return-stack-alteration restriction to some optional macro arguments
      implement .abbr directive
      add .if(...) [.elif(...)]* [.else] .endif directive set
        avoid full parsing of false branches (accommodate other cores?)
        add symbol for current core -- is9x8 (?)
    peripherals
      INTERRUPT
      timer
      UART_Rx -- single-byte deserializer w/ and w/o FIFO
      UART -- single-byte serdes w/ and w/o FIFO
      interrupt enable/disable (through INTERRUPT command)
      multi-byte adder
      multiplier
      PICK -- emulate the Forth operator?
        this can be done if the data stack is in its own dual-port memory, but that kinds of defeats the purpose of a small micro controller
      bus slave peripherals -- store external commands in a FIFO and statuses in dual-port RAM or shared RAM for external reads
        SPI_slave
        I2C_slave
      SoC Interconnects
        wishbone_slave
        avalon_slave
        wishbone_master
        avalon_master
        ARM_slave
    core.vhd
      do this once core.v is completed

  examples
    add more examples
      "echo" program
      Jim Haberly -- accumulate 10 samples from an ADC
    JPEG compression example?
      Cast's JPEG-E core: http://www.cast-inc.com/ip-cores/images/jpeg-e/index.html (1343 slices, 170 MHz, 7 RAMB16, 9 DSP48)
    Game-of-life?
      NxN image to NTSC monitor using small board to convert the image (where N is a power of 2 <= 256)
      scale to 256x256 displayed image
      use external 256x256/8 = 2^(8+8-3) = 2^13 = 8 kB memory
        one for display and one for next image (to allow smaller base images)
      control update rate (# screens between updates)
      input configuration through serial port and text commands
        ex: s     (stop)
            c     (clear)
            + 1 1 (set pixel at (1,1))
            + 1 2 (set pixel at (1,2))
            ...
            - 1 1 (clear pixel at (1,1))
            u 4   (set update rate to once every 4 screens)
            r     (run)

  lib/9x8/math.s
    -- incorporate adder peripheral
    -- add_u8_u32__u32, ...
    -- sub_uX_uY__uZ, X,Y,Z \in {8,16,24,32}, Z \in min(X,Y)+{0,8}, Z<=32
    -- add signed versions

  lib/9x8/forth.s
    -- identify good instructions to include
