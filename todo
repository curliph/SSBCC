  BUGS:

  ssbcc
*   add "localparam"
    incorporate "COMBINE" feature to merge stacks or memories into large RAMs
      INSTRUCTION+RAM/ROM
      INSTRUCTION+DATA_STACK
      ROM/RAM?
    add "share memory" feature?
      for dual-port memories in slave peripherals (i.e., registers readable by the bus master)
      for peripherals such as adders where long chains of outputs and inports would have been required and .store+/- and .fetch+/- would be much more efficient code-wise
      how to accommodate multiple "shared memory" peripherals?
    finish interrupt handling
    documentation
      top-level overview, point to implemented cores
      required:  ARCHITECTURE and sizes, ASSEMBLY, and HDL
      I/O Ports
      INPORT and OUTPORT
      PERIPHERAL
        finish doc/peripheral.html
      all error messages
    add VHDL

  core/9x8
*   finish the test bench to validate the core
      finish the validation
      add to the documentation
      add validations for various memory configurations

    core.v
      additional instructions?
        "invert" opcode in 6'b000100 group
        "tst&=" and "tst&<>" instructions -- replace T with the stated comparison based on the bitwise and of T and N
        "cmp=" and "cmp<>" instructions -- replace T with the statued comparison based on N-T
      speed up core
      determine settings to maximize speed or minimize resources
      implement interrupt handling
    asm
      require .memory directive to be repeated after other directives, EOF, etc.
      improve error message for missing input files
      add non-return-stack-alteration restriction to some optional macro arguments
      implement .abbr directive
      add .compile_if(...) [.compile_elif(...)]* [.compile_else] .compile_endif directive set
    peripherals
      INTERRUPT
      timer

      interrupt enable/disable (through INTERRUPT command)
      multi-byte adder
      multiplier
      PICK -- emulate the Forth operator?
