  BUG:
    "OUTPORT 1-bit,1-bit" produced malformed output mapping
    way for user to disable "verilator tracing_off"
    gracefully handle "eval(...,ad.SymbolDict())" errors
 
  ssbcc
    add CONSTANT configuration command so that bit definitions can accompany their definition
    ensure ARCHITECTURE is the first non-comment line
    validate signal names
      ensure that inport, outport, signal, and io names are not repeated
      ensure no colisions with signals within the core
    add config['parameters'] and usage for peripherals
    search paths for peripherals (code directory, core/9x8/peripherals, core/peripherals)
    put ssbccGenVerilog in a class in core/9x8
    Finish interrupt handling
    documentation
      top-level overview, point to implemented cores
      required:  ARCHITECTURE and sizes, ASSEMBLY, and HDL
      I/O Ports
      INPORT and OUTPORT
      PERIPHERAL
        finish doc/peripheral.html
    incorporate "COMBINE" feature
    add VHDL

  core/9x8
*   finish the test bench to validate the core
      finish the validation
      add to the documentation
    documentation
      update
      assembler
        directives
        instructions
          change "opcodes.html" to "instructions.html", ...
          remove "dis" and "ena"
        interrupts
      peripherals
    core.v
      change major opcodes to constants and incorporate in the peripherals
      speed up core
      determine settings to maximize speed or minimize resources
      finish interrupt handling
    asm
      required .memory directive to be repeated after .include, EOF, etc.
      improve error message for missing input files
      add non-return restriction to some optional macro arguments
      implement .abbr directive
    peripherals
      add the architecture line number to __init__
**    add a 'function' key to config for:
        clog
        instruction dump
      peripheral for simulations to flag bad stack operations
        add "finish=n"
        add "history=n"
        add "log"
*     UART_Tx
        accomodate parameter names in baudmethod
        add the FIFO
      INTERRUPT
      timer
      UART_Rx -- single-byte deserializer w/ and w/o FIFO
      UART -- single-byte serdes w/ and w/o FIFO
      interrupt enable/disable (through INTERRUPT command)
      multi-byte adder
      multiplier
      PICK -- emulate the Forth operator?
    core.vhd
      do this once core.v is completed
