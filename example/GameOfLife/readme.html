<h1>Introduction</h1>
  <i>Conway's Game of Life</i>, see
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Wikipedia</a>,
  is used as an example of a more complicated SSBCC.9x8 application.<br/><br/>
  The processor is used to propagate the machine state on a periodic basis as
  controlled by user input, the FPGA fabric is used to generate the output
  video, and several external SRAM are used as a ping pong buffer for the video
  display.<br/><br/>
  Scripts to build the game for various development boards are listed by FPGA
  vendor name.<br/><br/>
<h1>Theory of Operation</h1>
  The bit pattern for the game of life is stored in a 256x256 memory as 256x32
  8-bit values.  I.e., in 8&nbsp;kB of RAM.  Two copies of this memory are used,
  one for the image being displayed and one for the image being
  computed.<br/><br/>
  The processor reads three lines of the image into buffers and computes the new
  line of output based on those.  This architecture allows the processor to do
  an in-place update for the maximum update rate.<br/><br/>
